# spider_deep_sexer

Determine jumping spider sex with a ConvNet.

This is a simple CNN (convolutional neural network) approach to identify whether a spider in a top-down cropped photo is male or female. I explain the steps in this <a href="https://arachnarchy.github.io/spider_deep_sexer_notebook.nb.html">notebook</a>. I wrote this with behavioral video tracking in mind, where a fast and reliable way to id the sex of 'blobs' within video frames can be helpful (for instance when a tracking program switches the identity of a subject after a close interaction). The approach is mostly based on the excellent "Deep Learning in R" by F Chollet and JJ Allaire. Currently working with my model species _Habronattus pyrrithrix_ at >96% accuracy, can be further pushed by retraining the model with a larger batch of training images, adapted to a different species, or extended to work across species with a sufficiently large training image set.

The file hapy_sexer.h5 is an already pretrained neural network that can be used to classify an example image by running the file spider_sex_classify.R. The example image can be any aspect ratio or resolution, but should display a top-down view of a single H. pyrrithrix.
